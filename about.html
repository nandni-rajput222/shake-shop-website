          A milkshake is a cold and blended dairy-based beverage prepared using milk, ice-creams,flavoring syrups and sugars. It is available in a wide variety of flavors, such as vanilla, chocolate and strawberry. Various toppings, including sweetened dry cereal, toasted coconut, marshmallows, biscuits, fresh fruits, cinnamon, clove and dry cakes, are added to enhance the flavor of the beverage. Certain cafes and restaurants also offer savory variants prepared using olive oil, sesame seeds and sea salt. Thick milkshakes are usually prepared using commercial milkshake machines in professional kitchens, which have specialized settings for blending speed to adjust the consistency of the shake. They are commonly served in bottles, pouches and cartons.
          Significant growth in the food and beverage industry is one of the key factors creating a positive outlook for the market in the country. Moreover, increasing private label offerings across India is providing a thrust to the market growth. International milkshake brands are also establishing their franchise outlets in metropolitan cities for convenient product distribution. In line with this, changing lifestyles and dietary patterns of the consumers are also contributing to the market growth. With the increasing number of shopping malls and recreational centers, there is a shifting preference among consumers, especially millennials, from carbonated drinks toward milkshakes as a healthier alternative. Additionally, various product innovations, such as the launch of packaged milkshakes in novel flavors and ready-to-drink (RTD) travel-friendly packaging solutions, are acting as other growth-inducing factors. Product manufacturers are also developing milkshakes with natural and organic ingredients with no preservatives and artificial sugars to attract a wider consumer base. Other factors, including rapid urbanization, along with the increasing expenditure capacities of the consumers, are anticipated to drive the market toward growth.
